# My Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This repository is dedicated to all the projects I am working on for experimentation, fun, and learning purposes. Here, you will find a variety of projects ranging from front-end, back-end, to full-stack, using different frameworks, functionalities, data structures, APIs and technologies.

## Goals

- Experimentation: I use these projects to experiment with new ideas, technologies, and techniques.
- Fun: Building these projects is enjoyable and helps me stay motivated to learn more.
- Learning: Each project is an opportunity to learn something new and improve my skills.

## Current Projects

- [TIC-TAC-TOE]: TIC-TAC-TOE game created in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- [Online Movie Review React Web App]: This movie review web app was created in React for the front-end and Java/Spring Boot for the back-end with MongoDB for the database.
- [2048]: This 2048 game uses the Python Pygame library to recreate the 2048 game using the same mathematical logic and similar animations/colours.
- [Self-Driving Car]: This self-driving car JavaScript project with no libraries uses Machine Learning stored in local storage and Neural Networks to create self-driving car simulations based on different traffic scenarios.
