# My Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This repository is dedicated to all the projects I am working on for experimentation, fun, and learning purposes. Here, you will find a variety of projects ranging from front end, back end, to full-stack, using different frameworks and technologies.

## Goals

- Experimentation: I use these projects to try out new ideas, technologies, and techniques.
